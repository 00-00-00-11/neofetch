# Neofetch 1.8

This version of neofetch is vastly different from the previous versions and this<br \>
changelog won't cover everything that's changed. Have a look through the commit<br \>
history for more info.

There were a lot of major changes to how things work in this release so I'm expecting<br \>
bugs/things not working for people. Depending on what comes up we my release a few 1.8.X<br \>
versions.

This changelog is a bit of a mess this time around and I apologize but it should at least<br \>
get the message accross.

Android support didn't make it into this release as it requires testing on more devices.<br \>
If you've got a device running android and would like to help test out the branch, check<br \>
out the open PR here: [#322](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/pull/322)

This release also saw a lot more contributers which makes me really happy. Thanks to those<br \>
below for helping out. :)

### General

- Added `--version` to print the neofetch version.
- Fix issue when title and background were both color `7`.
- Fix issue with incorrect text color when `barinfo` is set.
- Fixed various Travis.ci bugs.
- Fix lint errors.
- Moved all whitespace trimming to a dedicated function.
    - Neofetch will no longer have any whitespace issues in the output.
    - See [trim()](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/commit/d3c87cdaacf1ea9fbf245146c910dc53b49dba08#diff-e863270127ca6116fd30e708cdc582fcR2789)
- Quote all variable/command substitutions.
- Removed `line_wrap` as having it set to `on` broke the output.
- Removed `stdout` mode since it's been broken for a while now and I don't see the<br\>
point in fixing it.
- Removed in-script config in favor of sourcing the default user config.
- Remove all instances of `! -z` since they're pointless.
- Remove all `bc` usage by simplifying math.
- Supress `getconfig` and `getscriptdir` errors.
- Supress `xprop` errors since it's now an optional dependency.
- The prompt is now dynamically set in image mode instead of being anchored to the<br \>
bottom of the window. See [#279](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/pull/279) and [#299](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/pull/299) for examples.
- The title at the top is now much more colorful.
- Moved commands near the bottom of the script to a new function called `main`.
- Use `read -s` instead of `stty -echo` and `stty +echo`.
- Use faster `$(())` syntax for index variables.
- `-v` now shows where the config files were sourced from.
- Cleanup
- Neofetch no longer clears the screen when run in ascii or image=off modes.
    - You can use the old behaviour by aliasing `clear && neofetch` to `neofetch`.
