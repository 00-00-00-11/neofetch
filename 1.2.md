- Fixed text padding when the user didn't have the locale 'en_US.UTF8' installed.
- `--ascii_distro` now also enables ascii mode.
- Check for packages based on which package manager is installed instead of<br \>
using a hardcoded list of distros.

ping for the public IP.

\[1\] Public IP requires an internet connection as we ping a website.


**Window Manager**:
- Grab last occurence of `^exec x` when parsing xinit files.
