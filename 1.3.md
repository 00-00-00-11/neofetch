# Fetch 1.3

- Fetch now supports **bash 3.0+**.
- More cleanup
- The text is now by default colored according to your distro's logo.
- Removed `$*_color` variables/flags in favour of a general `$colors`<br \>
variable/flag. See my writeup here: **https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/pull/96**

### Image

- You no longer need to set the font_width value, your font size<br \>
is now calculated by fetch.
- Image sizing now takes terminal height into account.
- `--size` now also takes a percentage as a value, for example.

```sh
# Image takes up 70% of the terminal size.
fetch --size 70%
```

### OS

- Added support for `BunsenLabs`.

### Info

- Don't display Theme, Icons, Font or Window Manager if X isn't running.

**Song**<br \>
- Added `song_shorthand` which prints the Artist/Title on seperate lines.

**Theme**<br\>
- Windows Visual Style is now a part of `getstyle`.
- Disabled theme output on OS X to fix a `gsetttings` related crash.
- Uppercase the first letter of the theme.

**Resolution**<br \>
- Added Windows support.
- Enabled by default but only displays info if the dependency is found.

**Battery**<br\>
- Added FreeBSD and OpenBSD support. Thanks **[@tudurom](https://github.com/tudurom)**

Printing to stdout in a plaintext format for use in scripts is now<br \>
much faster and cleaner.
